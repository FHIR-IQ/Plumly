- **Prompt Templates** - Pre-configured templates for patients, providers, and payers
- **Export Functionality** - Download summaries as TXT, JSON, or FHIR resources

### Technical Stack ‚úÖ
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes with serverless functions
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **FHIR Server:** Uses public HAPI FHIR test server for MVP
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready with optimized build configuration

### Documentation ‚úÖ
- **Specifications** - Complete technical requirements and API docs
- **Architecture** - System design and decision records
- **Security** - Healthcare-focused security requirements
- **Contributing** - Development guidelines and standards

## üß™ Testing the Deployment

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. **Upload Test:** Use `sample-data/sample-patient-bundle.json`
2. **Configuration Test:** Try different prompt templates and audiences
3. **Summarization Test:** Generate AI summaries with various options
4. **Export Test:** Download summaries in different formats

### 2. Sample Test Data
The repository includes sample FHIR data:
- **File:** `sample-data/sample-patient-bundle.json`
- **Patient:** John Michael Doe (test data)
- **Conditions:** Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension
- **Medications:** Metformin, Lisinopril
- **Observations:** Blood glucose, HbA1c, Blood pressure
- **Encounters:** Annual checkup, diabetes follow-up

### 3. Expected Results
- **Patient Summary:** Simple, easy-to-understand health overview
- **Provider Summary:** Clinical summary with medical terminology
- **Payer Summary:** Utilization-focused analysis
- **Export Formats:** TXT, JSON, and FHIR Composition downloads

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Errors
```bash
# If deployment fails, check these locally:
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript errors
npm run lint       # Linting issues
npm run build      # Production build
```

#### API Integration Issues
- **Claude API:** Verify API key is valid and has credits
- **FHIR Server:** Public server may have rate limits or downtime
- **CORS Issues:** Vercel handles CORS automatically

#### Environment Variables
- Ensure all required variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be kept secret
- Public variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

## üìä Performance Expectations

### Response Times
- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds
- **File Upload:** < 1 second for typical bundles
- **AI Summarization:** 3-8 seconds (depends on Claude API)
- **Export Generation:** < 1 second

### Usage Limits
- **Claude API:** Depends on your plan and credits
- **FHIR Server:** Public server shared with other users
- **Vercel:** Generous limits for hobby/personal plans

## üîí Security Notes

### Demo/POC Security
- **Test Data Only:** Never upload real patient data
- **Public FHIR Server:** Data is not private or persistent
- **API Keys:** Stored securely as Vercel environment variables
- **No Authentication:** MVP has no user login (demo purposes)

### Production Considerations
For production healthcare use, additional security measures required:
- User authentication and authorization
- Private FHIR server deployment
- HIPAA compliance measures
- Audit logging and monitoring

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Monitoring
- **Vercel Analytics:** Page views and performance metrics
- **Function Logs:** API endpoint execution and errors
- **Build Logs:** Deployment success/failure tracking

### Application Health
Monitor these metrics after deployment:
- API response times
- Error rates
- User interactions
- Claude API usage

## üéØ Demo Script

### For Stakeholders
1. **Show Homepage:** Clean, professional healthcare interface
2. **Upload Demo Data:** Use the provided sample bundle
3. **Configure Summary:** Select "Patient" audience and "Narrative" format
4. **Generate Summary:** Demonstrate AI summarization in action
5. **Show Results:** Display generated summary with metadata
6. **Export Functionality:** Download summary as FHIR Composition
7. **Try Different Audiences:** Show provider and payer summaries

### Key Demo Points
- **Healthcare Focus:** Designed specifically for healthcare data
- **AI-Powered:** Advanced Claude AI for medical text understanding
- **Standards Compliant:** Full FHIR R4 specification support
- **Multi-Audience:** Different outputs for different stakeholders
- **Production Ready:** Scalable architecture for enterprise use
